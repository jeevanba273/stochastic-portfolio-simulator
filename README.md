## Overview

This project simulates asset price trajectories using three popular stochastic models in quantitative finance:

- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
- **Jump-Diffusion**
- **Heston Model**

Utilizing **stochastic calculus**, **Monte Carlo methods**, and key portfolio risk metrics, the app visualizes simulated price paths, terminal value distributions, and detailed statistics such as **Sharpe Ratio**, **Max Drawdown**, and **Value at Risk (VaR)**.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation:** Adjust parameters and switch between different stochastic models.
- **Real-time Visualizations:** Dynamic, interactive plots of simulated price paths and distributions.
- **Comprehensive Risk Metrics:** View expected returns, standard deviation, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, and VaR.
- **Data Export:** Easily download your simulation data as a CSV file.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Streamlit for a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Models

| **Model**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GBM**         | The classic model for asset prices, featuring a log-normal distribution and constant volatility.                                                       |
| **Jump-Diffusion**  | Enhances GBM by incorporating rare, significant jumps to better simulate market shocks.                                                                  |
| **Heston**      | Introduces stochastic volatility, providing a closer representation of real market behavior.                                                              |
